    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

    <p>
        I want to become a software developer because I am passionate about technology, problem-solving,
        and building things that can help people in real life. The world is moving towards automation
        and digital solutions, and I want to contribute to that future. I enjoy learning new programming
        languages, creating projects, and improving my skills every day. Software development offers
        creativity, growth, and the opportunity to build something meaningful that can make an impact.
